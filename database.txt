The specific columns and fields in your database will depend on the specific needs of your app and how you want to organize the data. Here are some possible examples of what the "menu" and "orders" collections might look like:

"menu" collection:

Document for each food item, with fields such as:
"name" (string)
"description" (string)
"price" (number)
"image" (string, URL of the food item's image)
"orders" collection:

Document for each order, with fields such as:
"user" (reference to the user who placed the order)
"items" (array of objects, each representing a food item from the menu)
"total_price" (number, total price of the order)
"status" (string, current status of the order, e.g. "pending", "in progress", "completed")
You can add or remove fields as needed to suit your app's requirements. For example, you might want to add a "quantity" field to the "items" array to keep track of how many of each food item was ordered.
